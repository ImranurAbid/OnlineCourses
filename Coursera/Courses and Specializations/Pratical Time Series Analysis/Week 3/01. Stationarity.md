## [Stationarity](https://coursera.org/learn/practical-time-series-analysis/exam/ZbN0D/stationarity)



For a weakly stationary process, which of the following are true?

***[i]*** The mean function is constant.

***[ii]*** The variance function is constant.

*[iii]* The autocovariance is constant.

------

A random walk is an example of a weakly stationary process. 

*(a)* Yes.

***(b)*** No.

------

A moving average is an example of a weakly stationary process.

***(a)*** Yes.

*(b)* No.

------

Suppose you have the $MA(2)$ process:
$$
X_t=Z_t+.5 Z_{t-1}+.5Z_{t-2}, \space \space \space \sigma^2=1
$$
How many terms in the ACF are nonzero?

*(a)* There are no nonzero terms.

*(b)* Exactly 2.

***(c)*** Exactly 3.

*(d)* An infinite number.

------

Let's think about our $MA(2)$ process from the last question.
$$
X_t=Z_t+.5 Z_{t-1}+.5Z_{t-2}, \space \space \space \sigma^2=1
$$
What is the autocovariance at lag zero? That is, calculate $\gamma(0)$.

***Solution:*** $1.5$

------

Again, consider the $MA(2)$ example.
$$
X_t=Z_t+.5 Z_{t-1}+.5Z_{t-2}, \space \space \space \sigma^2=1
$$
 calculate the autocorrelation function at lag 2.

***Solution:*** $0.7946$

------

Run the following code to simulate our $MA(2)$ process as shown above. Be sure to replace *XX*'s with the appropriate coefficients.

```R
set.seed=1
(acf(arima.sim(n=1000, model=list(ma=c(XX,XX)))))
```

From your graph or the function output, estimate $\rho(1)$.

*(a)* $1$

***(b)*** $0.531$

*(c)* $0.338$
