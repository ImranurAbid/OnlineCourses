Let's take a look at the data set called *sunspots* (time series spotted below)*.* There isn't much of an apparent trend, but the series certainly seems to exhibit seasonality.

*Monthly mean relative sunspot numbers from 1749 to 1983.  Andrews, D. F. and Herzberg, A. M. (1985) Data: A Collection of Problems from Many Fields for the Student and Research Worker. New York: Springer-Verlag.*

The last observation is for December 1983. What is your forecast for January 1984?

Please use the following code to produce your coefficients. Recall our notation and method:
$$
\hat{x}_{n+h}=level_n+h∗trend_n+seasonal_{n+h−m}
$$

```R
HoltWinters(sunspots)
```



***(a)*** $32.14241$

*(b)* $44.44311347$

Let's stay with the data set called *sunspots*. 

*Monthly mean relative sunspot numbers from 1749 to 1983. Andrews, D. F. and Herzberg, A. M. (1985) Data: A Collection of Problems from Many Fields for the Student and Research Worker. New York: Springer-Verlag.*

What is your forecast (using *HoltWinters()* ) for April 1984?

```R
library(forecast)
forecast.HoltWinters( HoltWInters(sunspots) )
```



***Solution:*** $35.85608579$

Again, stay with the data set called *sunspots*.

*Monthly mean relative sunspot numbers from 1749 to 1983. Andrews, D. F. and Herzberg, A. M. (1985) Data: A Collection of Problems from Many Fields for the Student and Research Worker. New York: Springer-Verlag.*

Do you forecast that the monthly mean relative sunspot number for August 1985 will be higher or lower than the observed number for August 1983? Note: you can recover the measured value from August 1983 by typing: *sunspots* on the R command line. You should see the value:  August 1983 ($71.8$)



*(a)* August 1985 is forecast to be higher than August 1983.

***(b)*** August 1985 is forecast to be lower than August 1983.
