Enter the following dataset in R using concatenation operator. You may edit the code fragment below:

\### 37, 86, 79, 95, 61, 93, 19, 98, 121, 26, 39, 11, 26, 75, 29,130, 42, 8###

Obtain 5-number summary. You may edit the code fragment below. What is the sample mean?

```R
data=c() # Edit this line
summary() # Edit this line
```

​		***(a)*** 59.72 		*(b)* 51.50

------

Find the summary of the dataset given in the following code block. What is the 3rd quartile?

```R
data=c() # Edit this line
summary() # Edit this line
```

​		*(a)* 130 		***(b)*** 91.25		*(c)* 26.75

------

We look at the dataset titled '*cheddar*' from '*faraway*' package. Continue the code in the following code block to look at the description of the dataset '*cheddar*' using *help()* routine. How many observations and variables are there in the dataset?

```R
library(faraway)
```

​		*(a)* 4 observations and 30 variables

​		*(b)* 30 observations and 5 variables

​		***(c)*** 30 Observations and 4 variables

------

We are still working on the dataset '*cheddar*' from the package '*faraway*'. Apply simple linear regression model for the bivariate data '*taste*' (modeled as a random variable Y) vs '*H2S*' (modeled as a random variable X) in the dataset 'cheddar' in using *lm()* routine in the following code block. What is the model?

```R
library(faraway)
m=lm(taste~H2S, data=cheddar)
summary(m)
```

​		***(a)*** 
$$
Y=−9.7868+5.7761∗X+ϵ
\newline
where \space \space ϵ ∼ N(0,10.83^2).
$$
​		*(b)* 
$$
Y=−−9.7868+5.7761∗X+ϵ
\newline
where \space \space ϵ ∼ N(0,0.5712^2).
$$
​		*(c)* 
$$
Y=−1.643+6.107∗X+ϵ
\newline
where \space \space ϵ ∼ N(0,10.83^2).
$$

What is the sum of the residuals in the simple linear regression model of Question 4?

```R
library(faraway)
```

​		***(a)*** 0 		*(b)* 736

------

What is the sum of the fitted values in the simple linear regression model of Question 4? We can get the fitted values by using *lm()$fitted* routine. 

```
library(faraway)
```

​		*(a)* 0 		***(b)*** 736

------

Does this data set appear to  be normally distributed?

​		***(a)*** No. 		*(b)* Yes.

------

Suppose you are testing the null hypothesis that a population mean is 0 against the alternative that it is not zero at the alpha=0.05 level of significance.

Given the following function call and printout, can you reject your null hypothesis?

```R
data = c(7,  5,  1,  7,  2,  5,  2,  4, 10,  6);
t.test(data, alternative = "two.sided", paired=FALSE)
```

​		***(a)*** Yes. 		*(b)* No.

------

Do you believe the R printout matches the regression in the figure?

Call:

lm(formula = y ~ x)



Coefficients:

(Intercept)      x

-4.48               -2.82
