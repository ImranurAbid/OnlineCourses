Time plot of a time series is shown. What can be said about the stationarity of this time series?

![img](https://s2.loli.net/2021/12/07/UBzr9ya5vuKxqMN.png)

*(a)* It is a stationary time series.

*(b)* It is a non-stationary time series since there is a fluctuation.

*(c)* It is stationary since there is a trend. 

***(d)*** It is a non-stationary time series since there is a trend.

*[i]* It is stationary.

***[ii]*** It is non-stationary.

***[i]*** It is a stationary time series since there is no trend.

*[ii]* It is a stationary time series since there is no seasonality.

*[iii]* It is a non-stationary time series.

***[iv]*** It maybe combination of two stationary time series.

```R
# Simulating a non-stationary time series

# Set seed so thet we generate the same dataset
set.seed(2017)
# time variable 
t=seq(0,1,1/100)
# generate a time series
some.time.series=2+3*t+ rnorm(length(t))

# obtain acv for this time series below
```

What is sample autocovariance coefficient $c_5$?

*(a)* $5$

*(b)* $0.640$

***(c)*** $0.403$

*(d)* $1.717$

------

What is the sample autocorrelation coefficient $r_0$ for any time series?

*(a)* Depends on the time series.

***(b)*** It is 1.

------

```R
# Simulating a non-stationary time series

# Set seed so thet we generate the same dataset
set.seed(2017)
# time variable 
t=seq(0,1,1/100)
# generate a time series
some.time.series=2+3*t+ rnorm(length(t))
# obtain acf of the time series below
```

What is $r_5$?

***(a)*** $0.2333$

*(b)* Cannot be calculated since it is non-stationary time series.\\

*(c)* $1$â€‹

------


Which one or more of the following can be said about the random walk?

***[i]*** Random walk model relates current value of the time series to the previous value by adding some random deviation to the previous value.

*[ii]* Random walk is a stationary stochastic process.

***[iii]*** Random walk is the accumulation of random deviations from previous steps until the current time.

------

How one can obtain a stationary stochastic process from the random walk?

***(a)*** Using the difference operator.

*(b)* One cannot.

------

Which one or more of the following can be said about moving average processes?

***[i]*** The current value of the process now is a linear combination of the noises from current and past time steps.

*[ii]* The current value of the process now is a linear combination of the noises from current and past time steps.

***[iii]*** Autocorrelation function of the process cuts off and becomes zero at the order of the process.

------

```R
# Simulating MA(4) process.
# X_t= Z_t+0.2 Z_(t-1)+0.3 Z_(t-2)+ 0.4 Z_(t-3)

set.seed(2^10)
z=NULL
z=rnorm(1000)
data=NULL
for(i in 4:1000){
  data[i-3]=z[i]+0.2*z[i-1]+0.3*z[i-2]+0.4*z[i-3]
  }
